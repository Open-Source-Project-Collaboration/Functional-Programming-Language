Currently there's no code avaiable


## Development

You can read [the docs here](~docs/01%20-%20Getting%20Started.md) and if you ever
happen to stuck, we probably have a tutorial for it in [here](RESOURCES.md)!

For the moment, generate your build files:

- windows: `premake5 vs2019`
- linux: `premake5 gmake`
- mac: `premake5 xcode4`

You can then use your favoured platform (Visual studio, XCode, Linux etc.)
to build the binaries/libraries. All built files go into __bin/__.


## Tech stack

- [premake5](https://premake.github.io/): as the build system
- [clang](https://clang.llvm.org/): as the compiler
- [neovim](https://neovim.io/): (for those who can use) as the code editor
- [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/): (for those who can't) as the IDE


Lasty but most importantly, love and compassion <3


## A little warning

Please, for the love of god,
[at least read this before submitting anything](~docs/02%20-%20Coding%20Style.md).
