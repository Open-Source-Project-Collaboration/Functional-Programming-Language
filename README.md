Currently there's no code avaiable


## Development

You can start by reading [the docs](docs/01%20-%20Getting%20Started.md)

But simply but, to build the project

- for windows: `premake5 vs2019`
- for linux: `premake5 gmake`
- for mac: `premake5 xcode4`

These generate build files for the appropriate OS.

You can then use your favoured platform (Visual studio, XCode, Linux etc.)
to build the binaries/libraries.

All built files go into __bin/__.


## Tech stack

- [premake5](https://premake.github.io/): as the build system
- [clang](https://clang.llvm.org/): as the compiler
- [neovim](https://neovim.io/): (for those who can use) as the code editor
- [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/): (for those who can't) as the IDE


Lasty but most importantly, love and compassion <3
