# 02 - Coding Style and Conventions

This project uses

- 8-char length __tabs__
- Only function definitions have their curly braces __on a newline__
- Snake case naming for everything
- typedef'ing structs and adding "_t" suffix to them

> PR's disrespecting these rules must not be permitted/merged/considered logical.
